  "description": "Practice using if, elif, and else statements to control the flow of your Python program based on conditions.",
  "examples": [
    {
      "input": "x = 10\nif x > 5:\n    print('Greater than 5')\nelse:\n    print('5 or less')",
      "output": "Greater than 5"
    }
  ],
  "constraints": [
    "Use at least one if, one elif, and one else statement.",
    "Include a condition with a comparison operator (>, <, ==, etc.).",
    "Handle at least three possible outcomes."
  ],
  "starterCode": "x = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\n# Write your if, elif, else conditions below\n",
  "hints": [
    "Use comparison operators like ==, >, <, >=, and <=.",
    "if checks the first condition, elif checks others, else covers remaining cases.",
    "Example: if age >= 18: print('Adult')"
